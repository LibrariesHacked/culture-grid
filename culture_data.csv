"The Manx Museum, Isle of Man","In 1886 the Museum and Ancient Monuments Trustees were established by Act of Tynwald.

By coincidence, the building which houses the original Manx Museum was erected that same year but not until 1922, when the Henry Bloom Noble Trustees decided they needed to move the hospital to larger premises, was the building handed over as a first permanent home for the Manx Museum. 

With the celebration of their centenary in 1986, the Trustees revealed plans for an ambitious programme of development including a major new ����1.3 million extension scheme which would greatly enlarge the facilities on offer to the public.

The following two years saw the opening of a new Prehistoric Archaeology Gallery which won the ������Museum of the Year������ award as the best new Archaeology Gallery in the British Isles, and a very successful temporary exhibition gallery, forming part of a phased redesign of all the Museum������s major galleries

The new extension to the Manx Museum in Douglas had a royal opening in 1989 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Lord of Mann. The new building houses a lecture/film theatre with seating for over 200 people. From here the new National Art Gallery and dramatic Map Gallery link through into the redesigned galleries of the original building. Also accommodated are the Manx National Heritage Educational Services unit, a fully equipped conference area and a modern technical services area for the organisation������s hard-working technical team.

Today, this ������Treasure House of Mann������ is the National Museum of the Island and headquarters of the Trust������s Island-wide services. Now the ability and skill of Manx National Heritage in co-ordinating all the Island������s heritage assets, together with greatly improved facilities and services, enables the Trust to effect a complete interpretative and marketing strategy for Manx heritage.",,"Douglas,IM1 3LY",IM1 3LY,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/manxmuseum.xml,2014-03-23T21:13:05.018Z,enquiries@mnh.gov.im,01624 648001,01624 648000

Crafts Study Centre,"The Crafts Study Centre (CSC) was established and registered as a charity in 1970 by a small group of craft practitioners and educators determined to protect the best British crafts of the 20th century. Today, the Centre enjoys an international standing as a unique collection and archive of 20th century and contemporary crafts. 



The Centre's collection embraces ceramics, textiles, calligraphy, and furniture, accompanied by makers' diaries, working notes and photographs. Much of the collection has been built up from donations and bequests and includes work by such influential figures as Bernard Leach, Lucie Rie, Hans Coper, Ethel Mairet, Phyllis Barron, Edward Johnston and Ernest Gimson. 



The CSC opened at the Holburne Museum of Art, Bath in 1977 where it resided until 2000 when the Centre relocated to the University College for the Creative Arts at Farnham (formerly known as The Surrey Institute of Art & Design), where a new, purpose-built museum was to be constructed. While in storage from 2000 to 2003, an online resource of some 4,000 digital images was created as part of a digitisation project funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC): http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/collections/CSC.html. In Autumn 2003 the Centre was awarded a grant from the Regional Arts Lottery Programme by Arts Council England for a scheme to commission a series of permanent craft works at the Centre. In May 2004 Sir Christopher Frayling performed the opening ceremony of the new building in his last act as Chairman of the Crafts Study Centre, a role he had held for more than 20 years. The Crafts Study Centre opened to the public in June 2004 in its new home. In February 2005 the Centre received accreditation from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA). Also in 2005 the Centre was awarded a three-year grant from the Esm&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;e Fairbairn Foundation to fund a part-time marketing manager and profile-raising efforts. From 2006 the Centre will receive a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council core funding scheme for museums and galleries.",The Crafts Study Centre is fully accessible to wheelchair users. There is a toilet accessible to wheelchair users and with baby-changing facilities. Induction loop at reception.,"Falkner Road

"Rushen Abbey, Ballasalla, Isle of Man","Rushen Abbey is the most substantial and important medieval religious site in the Isle of Man. Sitting by the Silverdale Burn in what is now Ballasalla, the Abbey lies less than two miles from Castle Rushen, the main seat of political power during this period. Acquired by the Manx Government in 1998 it was transferred to Manx National Heritage and forms a major presentation which examines not only the important story of this site but also the Christian heritage of the Island. Parts of the Abbey buildings still survive and over several years will be enhanced through expert consolidation as more of the archaeological remains are exposed through excavation and brought to public view.

King Olaf I, the statesman son of Godred Crovan, granted the land on which the Abbey was built in 1134. Originally home for monks of the Sauvignac order, the Abbey soon came within Cistercian control. It developed as the Island������s seat of religious power and would have housed the main body of knowledge and literacy for the Island. With the Abbey are associated the most important medieval documents relating to the Island, including the Chronicles of the Kings of Man and the Isles.

The Abbey church and cloister lay at the heart of a range of buildings which followed the requirements of the life of worship and work which the rule of St Benedict laid down. The Abbey was surrounded by an estate or demesne which extended for over a mile to the south and west and was directly operated from the Abbey itself. Land holdings further afield in the parish of Malew and north into Lezayre and Lonan were under its control and the whole arrangement formed an agricultural and economic unit far in excess of any other estate on the Island at that time.

Visitors to Rushen Abbey will have the chance to learn about Christianity on the Island and what life was like for the Cistercian community here. They can walk through the remains of substantial medieval buildings and see where archaeological research has revealed traces of buildings below ground. Archaeological excavations and a long-term programme of building conservation continue to enhance our knowledge of this important site.",,"Ballasalla,Isle of Man,IM9 3DB",IM9 3DB,,,Local/Regional government,,,,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/rushenabbey.xml,2014-03-23T21:13:28.688Z,enquiries@mnh.gov.im,01624 648001,01624 648000

"Roehampton University, Archives and Special Collections","Roehampton is one of the newest universities in the UK, having been established in 2004. At the same time, through our four Colleges which have come together to found the University, we have a proud and distinguished history dating back to the 1840s, particularly in the field on Childhood Studies and Education. Our Colleges were also among the first colleges of higher education in the country to admit women. That tradition of commitment to equality continues to be part of the ethos of Roehampton, which has one of the most diverse communities of students in the UK.



Roehampton is a small, friendly, collegiate community where students can live, learn and socialise together on a beautiful and historic campus in southwest London. We offer a range of excellent facilities as well as easy access to the world-class museums, libraries and galleries of one of the most exciting and successful cities in the world.","Car parking for disabled available at LRC entrance.

Blackburn Museum And Art Gallery,"The bulding of the then Museum & Free Library was completed in 1874. The library occupied the ground floor with the museum on the first floor. In the 1970's a purpose built library was opened in the town center to which the library moved and building became Blackburn Museum & Art Gallery across both floors. Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery can be described as mildly Gothic with touches in the direction of the Arts and Crafts movement. One of the largest gifts to be bequeathed is the Hart Collection of numismatics, illuminated manuscripts and early printed books form by a local rope manufacture, Robert Edward Hart (1876 ������ 1946). The public collection is recognized as one of the best outside London. As Blackburn and the surrounding areas prospered into a Cotton Town, so too did the wealth of Mill owners and philanthropists, many of whom presented or bequeathed important artworks which went on to form a large collection of watercolours, oil paintings and Japanese woodblock prints.",,"Museum Street

University of Leeds International Textiles Archive,"The acquisition of items forming the ULITA textile collections began back in the 19th century. The first Professor and his successor in the Department of Textile Industries of the Yorkshire College, later to become the University of Leeds, began to collect fabric samples, pattern books and folios to use as a teaching resource for students of woven textile design. In 1892 the items contained in the collection had increased in size and importance so much that a donation by the Clothworkers Company allowed for the provision of a Museum. Over the following decades many further acquisitions followed. 

The ULITA Museum is now situated in the beautiful surroundings of St.Wilfed's Chapel on the campus of Leeds University.","Disabled access and toilet

"Medway Council, Medway Archives & Local Studies Centre","Rochester upon Medway City Archives opened to the public in April 1990. The service was funded, equipped and housed by Rochester upon Medway City Council. Three staff were employed at the office on the staff establishment of Kent County Council, then Archives Authority, who recharged the City Council for their salaries. In April 1993 Rochester upon Medway Studies Centre was launched, combining Rochester upon Medway City Archives and Kent County Council's Rochester upon Medway area library service local studies collections. In April 1998 upon the creation of the Medway Council unitary authority, the service was renamed Medway Archives and Local Studies Centre and the staff transferred to Medway Council.",Person lift; automatic exterior doors; Evac Chair; loop system; screen reader software for visually impaired.,"Strood

The Vaughan Williams Memorial Library,"Today the library is called the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library (VWML) in honour of the eminent composer, song collector and President of the EFDSS, Ralph Vaughan Williams, who died in 1958.  Up 'til then it was called the Cecil Sharp Library because it chiefly comprised Sharp������s personal library, which he bequeathed to the EFDS in 1924.  Its first permanent home was established with the opening of Cecil Sharp House in 1930, and Sharp������s daughter Joan was the first librarian.  With the amalgamation of EFDS and the Folk-Song Society and subsequent bequests, donations and purchases, the library has developed considerably over the years, most notably with the addition of the literature, sound and manuscript collections of other eminent folklorists and collectors of the twentieth century.",,,,,,Other,,,The English Folk Dance and Song Society,London,,http://www.efdss.org,2014-03-23T21:18:29.862Z,,,

"The National Folk Museum at Cregneash, Isle of Man","The National Folk Museum at Cregneash provides a living, working illustration of life in a typical 19th century Manx upland crofting community.



Nestling under Meayll Hill and overlooking the Calf of Man, Cregneash is isolated from the rest of Mann and at the beginning of the 20th century was one of the last strongholds of the traditional customs, crafts and skills which characterised the Manx Crofter&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;s way of life.



The threat posed by modern developments initiated practical steps by a small band of Manx patriots, scholars and enthusiasts towards preserving this unique site.



Professor Carl Marstrander, Professor of Celtic at the University of Oslo, made the first sound recordings of Manx speech with Harry Kelly, a crofter and fluent Manx speaker, and as a result of this work and through the efforts of William Cubbon, the Director of the Manx Museum at the time, Harry Kelly&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;s cottage became the starting point of the National Folk Museum at Cregneash, when it was restored and opened to the public for the first time in 1938. The subsequent addition of other buildings together with large areas of the surrounding countryside have further enhanced this authentic picture of traditional Manx crofting life.



The village now forms a centre for traditional farming practices and skills. Visitors can see the fields being worked with horse-drawn equipment, thatching of the roofs, dying of wool, spinning, weaving, wood-turning, black-smithing and a range of skills in the growing and preparation of food.",,"Cregneash Road,,Cregneash,IM9 5PX,Isle of Man",IM9 5PX,,,Higher Education,,,Isle of Man Government,,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/cregneashvillage.xml,2014-03-23T21:18:36.803Z,enquiries@mnh.gov.im,01624648001,01624648000

"The Grove, Ramsey, Isle of Man","The Grove House near Ramsey was developed in the mid 19th century by Duncan Gibb, a Liverpool shipping merchant, as a summer retreat for himself and his family. This modest sized Victorian villa presents a series of period rooms containing mostly original furnishings and fittings, a costume room, and general displays which include the accumulated possessions of three generations. At the rear, the complex of outbuildings would have mainly served the substantial adjoining farmland and contains early vehicles and agricultural equipment including a restored horse-powered threshing mill. 

The existence of the Grove today owes much to the desire of Duncan Gibb������s granddaughters, the Misses Janet and Alice Gibb, that their lovingly preserved legacy be maintained as a period museum after their demise.",,"Andreas Road

Museum of the Jewellery Quarter,"When the elderly proprietors of the Smith & Pepper jewellery manufacturing firm decided to retire in 1981 they simply ceased trading and locked the door, unaware they would be leaving a time capsule for future generations. Tools were left strewn on benches; grubby overalls were hung on the coat hooks; and dirty teacups were abandoned alongside jars of marmite and jam on the shelf.In the eighty years before its closure little changed with the working practices or equipment used within the family-owned business. Even the d����cor had more in common with early 20th-century trends than a thriving business in the early 1980s. Nowadays the factory is a remarkable museum, which tells the story of the Jewellery Quarter and Birmingham������s renowned jewellery and metalworking heritage. There are live demonstrations of traditional jewellery-making skills and visitors can get first-hand experience of what it was like to work in this noisy and busy workshop.",,"75-79 Vyse Street

University of Wolverhampton,"The University of Wolverhampton gained its university status in 1992, but Wolverhampton as a city has a strong history of education dating back hundreds of years to 1512 and initial plans to found Wolverhampton Grammar School. 

It was 400 years later that the seeds of the University itself were sown with the creation of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College. A merger with the local College of Art saw the birth of The Polytechnic, Wolverhampton, in 1969. 

Since becoming a University, Wolverhampton has continued to grow, opening a multi-million pound campus in Telford in 1994, the Wolverhampton Science Park in partnership with Wolverhampton Council in 1996. In 1997, two hi-tech Learning Centres in Telford and Wolverhampton opened offering state-of-the-art facilities to students and staff alike. While 1999 has seen the launch of the Regional Primary Centre, Leadership Centre and Competitiveness Centre, each offering unprecedented levels of support to the local community in education and business.",,,,,,Further/Higher Education,,,,West Midlands,,http://www.wlv.ac.uk/,2014-03-23T21:21:15.429Z,,,

"The Great Laxey Wheel & Mines Trail, Isle of Man","The Great Laxey Wheel was named ������Lady Isabella������ after the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man. It is now the largest surviving wheel of its kind in the world.

Designed by the Victorian engineer, Mr. Robert Casement, the wheel was built in 1854 to pump water from the Glen Mooar part of the ������Great Laxey Mines������ industrial complex. The impressive 22m (72.5 feet) diameter structure found immediate popularity and has remained one of the Island������s most dramatic tourist attractions for over 150 years.

The ������Lady Isabella������ survived largely through the efforts of one man, Laxey builder Edwin Kneale, who acquired the wheel to save it from being scrapped. Kneale operated the wheel as a tourist attraction until its purchase by the Manx Government in 1965 when a programme of complete restoration eventually returned the great wheel to its former glory. Subsequent acquisition of a neighbouring area of Glen Mooar made possible the extensive programme of surveys and clearance which established the Laxey Mines Trail.",,"Laxey

Colchester Castle Museum,"Colchester Castle is one of the most important historic buildings in Britain.
Underneath the Castle are the remains of the most famous building in Roman Britain, the huge Temple of Claudius, the first and largest Classical building constructed in Roman Britain.

The building of the Castle was probably underway by 1076. the great stone base of the temple was an obvious foundation. largely in consequence of the size of the temple, Colchester Castle was the largest Norman keep ever built.

Today the Castle acts as Colchester Museums' archaeological museum while the substructure of the temple is preserved underneath.","The castle has level or ramped access to the ground floor, a lift to the first floor and an accessibile toilet on the ground floor. Induction loops are fitted in appropriate locations throughout the museum. However tours of the Castle itself do include two sets of steep stairs and so are not accessible for people with mobility problems. Alternative audio/visual tours are available.","Castle Park,Colchester,Essex,CO1 1UD",CO1 1UD,0.902516856276776,51.8917806865353,Local/Regional government,,,,East of England,"Colchester Museums,

"Leicester City Council, Multicultural and RE Centre Library","The Centre for Multicultural Education was set up in the late 1980s following a report on Multicultural Education from a working party convened by Leicestershire County Council.
One of the briefs was to provide an exemplar collection of multicultural & anti-racist curriculum resources for teachers working in Leicestershire Schools. The Centre was established at Rushey Mead Primary School and moved to the Melbourne Centre ca 1993. Following local government reorganisation, in 1997, the running of the Centre was taken over by Leicester City Council who moved us to Forest Lodge Education Centre which already housed the RE collection. We continued to serve Leicestershire County schools for a couple of years until the County set up their own centre at Quorn Hall. 
In the early 1990s the Language Support Service joined the Multicultural Education Service and we began to collect resources relating to English as an Additional Language (EAL) and bilingualism.",,"Eastern Annex, County Hall,Glenfield,Leicester,Leicestershire,LE3 8SS,England",LE3 8SS,-1.18829917711626,52.6557949327534,Local/Regional government,,,Leicestershire,East Midlands,Telephone to ensure the material you want is available and that the library is open.

"University of Cambridge, St John's College Old Library","St John's College Library was opened in 1516. By 1616 the growth of its collections of printed books and manuscripts necessitated its removal to a new building, and in 1628 the Old Library, as it is now known, was completed.

Herbert Art Gallery And Museum,"Building information

The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum opened on the present site in 1960. In the 2000s a major redevelopment took place which was completed in October 2008. This included a complete refurbishment of the original building and the creation of a landmark glass roofed extension. The Herbert is now operated by the Coventry Heritage and Arts Trust.



Collections overview

The collections are wide ranging and cover the social and industrial history of Coventry, the archaeology of the city, natural history and visual arts.



Display overview

The redevelopment of the Herbert included the creation of several new permanent galleries which are based on the collections. These include the History Gallery, which tells the story of Coventry and its people from the medieval period to the present; Discover Godiva, a hands-on gallery aimed at families, which covers the story of Lady Godiva; Peace and Reconciliation deals with the city's role in promoting peace and reconciliation since the Second World War; Elements is a multi-sensory natural history gallery, which encourages an exploration of the collections and displays through a variety of media; Old Masters, Sculpture and Art Since 1900 showcase the Herbert's visual arts collections; What's In Store is an open store facility where visitors can explore objects from across the collections. There is also an active temporary exhibition programme.



Star objects

A number of the oil paintings are particularly significant, including Bacchus and Ariadne by Luca Giordano, a portrait of George III by Thomas Lawrence and more modern works by L.S. Lowry, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Ben Nicholson and others. There are also  sculptures by Barbara Hepworth and Jacob Epstein. The museum has an important collection which reflects the city's silk ribbon weaving industry, including sample books and a jacquard loom. There are also a number of items which belonged to the author George Eliot. Highlights of the archaeology collections include an Anglo-Saxon hanging bowl, a 15th century helmet and a 15th century carving of St George and the dragon.",,"Jordan Well

Manx National Heritage,"Manx National Heritage is a unique organisation in Europe. It combines the statutory responsibility for a complete portfolio of heritage responsibilities on behalf of the Government and the people of the Isle of Man.  These responsibilities include: The National Museum Service; The National Monuments Service; The National Trust Service; The National Archive; The National Art Gallery.
 
Manx National Heritage exists independently by Statute on behalf of the Manx community to preserve, protect, promote and communicate the unique qualities of the Manx natural and cultural heritage. Through the professional management, presentation and study of this heritage, Manx National Heritage will provide three fundamental benefits for the Manx nation:

1. Community involvement in Manx heritage to a level which guarantees the permanent retention of these unique assets for the benefit of present and future generations, thereby providing for the continuing security of the Manx identity. 
2. A platform for national pride and concern for the Island������s heritage which is actively promoted to the Island������s educational community at all levels in a positive and enriching way. 
3. A focus for marketing the Island in a prestigious and attractive way by presenting an image of one of the most concentrated and best cared for historic landscapes in Europe.
 
A vital part of this mission is achieved by involving the local community in a strategy for educational and commercial benefit which provides for the long-term protection and retention of the Island������s natural and heritage assets.

The work of Manx National Heritage is based on a firm and lasting partnership with all sectors of the community. It is a partnership based upon trust in the quality and integrity of the service which we provide and our ability to prove its relevance to modern life.

The needs of all sectors of both the resident and the visiting communities are considered in order to provide a common platform of agreement about the merits of the Manx heritage assets and the continuance of a strong Manx cultural identity.",,"Douglas,Isle of Man,IM1 3LY",IM1 3LY,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/,2014-03-23T21:21:31.49Z,enquiries@mnh.gov.im,+44(0)1624 648001,+44(0)1624 648000
"The House of Manannan, Isle of Man","Using state-of-the-art display techniques, the House of Manannan explores the Celtic, Viking and Maritime traditions of the Isle of Man. This exploration of themes essential to Manx nationhood was declared British Museum of the Year and given an award by the Society for the Interpretation of Britain������s Heritage for the Interpretation of Britain������s Heritage. Sitting by the harbour in the City of Peel, the award-winning building draws upon Manx vernacular architecture and looks across to the stronghold of Peel Castle.

Manannan is the Island������s great mythological sea god and protector who could shroud the place with a cloak of mist to protect it from its enemies. As a shapeshifter, Manannan could appear in many guises and in his ������House������ he himself acts as the visitor������s guide sometimes a god, sometimes a sailor, sometimes in other forms.

The story begins with the pagan Celts who built great roundhouses and responded to the Christian missionaries who fished the Irish Sea for souls. The Christian Celtic Island was threatened by the force of the pagan Viking incomers who settled, married into the local families and converted to Christianity themselves.

Throughout its history the Island has sat like a roundabout in the middle of the Irish Sea and was the heart of the medieval Kingdom of Mann and the Isles. The Island and the Manx people play a fascinating part in maritime history with ships and sailors travelling all over the world. For such a community, the sea is an important partner in many activities be it fishing, travelling or even smuggling and shipping companies act as one of the Island������s lifeline links with the neighbouring islands.

The House of Manannan explores and presents the dramatic story of the Island������s history. It brings to life themes which are both ancient and modern, and encourages the visitor to go out and explore the richness of the Manx landscape in all its wealth of history.",,"Peel,Isle of Man",,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/manannan.xml,2014-03-23T21:21:31.494Z,,,+44(0)1624 648090
"Peel Castle, St Patrick's Isle, Isle of Man","Peel Castle, one of the Isle of Man������s principal historic monuments occupies the important site of St Patrick������s Isle at Peel. The Castle������s Curtain Wall encircles the ruins of many buildings which are a testimony to the site������s religious and secular importance in Manx history. These include St. Patrick������s Church and the Round Tower from the 11th century, the 13th century Cathedral of St. German, and the later apartments of the Lords of Mann. The importance of the Isle as a centre of Manx Christianity was established in the 6th century and this role was to survive the arrival of the ������pagan������ Norse Vikings at the end of the 8th century. In the 11th century it became the ruling seat of the Norse Kingdom of Man and the Isles, first united by Godred Crovan.

A major six year programme of archaeological excavation commencing in 1982 emphasised the prime importance of the site. The most dramatic find was the Norse-period grave of a lady of high social status; the jewellery and effects buried with her can be seen on display with other excavation finds in the Manx Museum.

After 1333, the construction of the best preserved building, the Gatehouse, was followed by the completion of the Curtain Wall and later by the emplacement of artillery. St German������s Cathedral was remodelled and the adjoining residential block of the Vicars Chorale became the ������Lords House������, the apartments of a succession of Lords of Mann installed at this time.

The Revestment of the Sovereignty of the English Crown in 1765 found the importance of Peel Castle in decline and its buildings were allowed to decay through a period of limited military use which ended in the latter half of the 19th century.

Today, the House of Manannan provides an exciting introduction to St Patrick������s Isle, while ������Manannan������s Tour of Peel Castle������ provides each visitor to the Castle with a personal electronic guide. The voice of Manannan himself explains the great stories in the stones which still stand here.",,"Peel,Isle of Man",,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/peelcastle.xml,2014-03-23T21:21:31.498Z,,,
"Castle Rushen, Castletown, Isle of Man","Castle Rushen is probably the finest medieval castle in the British Isles.

The Castle is situated at the centre of Mann's historic capital, Castletown, and is one of Europe's most finely preserved medieval castles. Its origins can be found in the Norse period when Norse Kings fortified a strategic site guarding the entrance to the Silverburn River. The Castle was developed by successive rulers of Mann between the 13th and 16th centuries, and its towering limestone walls would have been visible over much of southern Mann - a continual reminder to the local population of the dominance of the Kings and Lords of Mann.

Today, detailed displays illustrate the Castle at various times in its history, with figures in period costume, historical furnishings and wall hangings, realistic food, contemporary music and medieval speech.",,"Castletown,Isle of Man",,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/castlerushen/,2014-03-23T21:21:31.505Z,,,
"The Old Grammar School, Castletown, Isle of Man","This small whitewashed building has witnessed many changes in the life of the community that it was built to serve over 650 years ago. It was the first town church for the settlement that grew up around Castle Rushen, fortress of the Norse Kings of Man and the Isles. The main wing is the oldest roofed structure in the Island������older than all but the lowest courses of masonry of the Castle itself.

St Mary������s Chapel was also used as a school from at least 1570 and served exclusively in that capacity after 1702. It is best known for the Academic School, the forerunner of King William������s College, and the Grammar School which finally closed in 1930.

The building was only saved from demolition by the Museum Trustees nailing a preservation order onto its door in 1950 with the Museum later purchasing and restoring it.",,"Castletown,Isle of Man",,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/oldgrammar.xml,2014-03-23T21:21:31.51Z,,,
"The Nautical Museum, Castletown, Isle of Man","Situated on the harbourside in Castletown this fascinating building originates from the discovery in 1935 of the 18th century armed yacht, the ������Peggy������, walled up in her contemporary boat cellar. Built for George Quayle in 1791, she had remained undisturbed for a century after the death of her owner. The ������Peggy������, in her original home, was generously given to the Manx Museum by a family descendant and is now seen as being of 'extraordinary' maritime importance on the National Historic Ships Register.

The boathouse over the cellar reveals the personality and interests of its designer, Mr Quayle. Here are trap doors, secret panels, and architectural jokes, plus a replica stern cabin from a naval warship of the ������Nelson������ period. The loft houses the reconstruction of a sail-maker������s workshop and the fishing gallery includes boat models, equipment and photographs reflecting the importance of the fishing industry.",,"Castletown,Isle of Man",,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/nauticalmuseum.xml,2014-03-23T21:21:31.516Z,,,
"The Old House of Keys, Castletown, Isle of Man","The history of The Old House of Keys building is one chapter in the long, and often turbulent, history of Manx politics which stretches back to the 9th and 10th centuries when the Viking Kings ruled the Isle of Man. After it ceased to be used by the Members of the Keys, the Old House of Keys building led a chequered life.

It has been occupied by various banks, the Castletown Commissioners and the Rural Library, until finally lying empty for nearly twenty years from the 1980s. Manx National Heritage took over responsibility for the building in millennium year 2000 and commenced a careful conservation programme to restore the original features of the building. 

The Old House of Keys has been restored to its appearance in 1866; a milestone in Manx history, when the old self-elected House of Keys took its first steps along the road to modern democracy by passing the 'House of Keys Election Bill' and thereby becoming a popularly elected body.

Inside The Old House of Keys debating chamber you can vote on various crucial issues which the Manx Parliament has faced in the past, and some it may have to face in the future. This provides an opportunity to see how democracy developed in the Island, sometimes years ahead of England, and the effect that political decisions have had and can continue to have on the Manx nation.

Manx National Heritage has restored The Old House of Keys to provide visitors with an insight into the political life and times of the Island. We hope that you enjoy this chapter of 'The Story of Mann' and will discover the other sites of political interest, past and present, around the Island.

Physical evidence of the Island's political history can be found throughout the Manx landscape from Tynwald Hill at St Johns through to the majestic castles at Peel and Castletown.",,"Castletown,Isle of Man",,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/houseofkeys/index.xml,2014-03-23T21:21:31.524Z,,,
"Niarbyl, Isle of Man","The area around Niarbyl Bay was acquired by Manx National Heritage through bequests and purchase, and is now part of the co-ordinated presentation of the scenic and historical landscape of the Island. Best known for the thatched cottages on the shore, Niarbyl has, for many decades, been one of the most popular places to visit. The area is not only visually exceptional but has a deeper importance geologically and historically to the Isle of Man. The interpretation and explanation of the significance of the shore area and beyond is presented within a visitor centre providing excellent food as well as much food for thought.",,,,,,Local/Regional government,,,Isle of Man Government,North West,,http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/countryside/niarbyl.xml,2014-03-23T21:21:31.528Z,,,
"The Sound Visitor Centre, Isle of Man","The Sound Centre has been built by Manx National Heritage to provide catering, interpretation and other facilities for visitors to the Sound. Whether you have come by foot, bus, car or boat, you will find a welcome here and a chance to enjoy the spectacular panoramic views. Sit for a while as you eat and drink, and learn to recognise the birds that pass by, watch the currents racing through the Sound or simply take in one of the best views in the British Isles. In the Centre you will find displays which tell the story of the Sound and the Calf of Man. Once outside, take some time to look at the building, carefully designed to fit into this precious place. Explore the Parade and watch the seals hauled out on Kitterland; then think about the wealth of life there is under the water. Afterwards choose to go eastwards to Burroo Ned and Spanish Head; or westwards towards Port Erin; or follow the road to Cregneash and learn what life was like for those who farmed here.

Guernsey Museum and Art Gallery,"The States of Guernsey first became involved with museums after the death of Francis Du Bois Lukis, in 1907. Following the wishes of his father, (the respected antiquarian and polymath Frederick Corbin Lukis) Francis bequeathed the family archaeology and geology collections to the Island - on condition that they be opened to the public as a museum. A further substantial bequest of fine and decorative art was left to the Island in 1930, by Wilfred Carey, a retired diplomat from one of Guernsey's oldest families. The Lukis and Carey collections were combined just before the outbreak of the Second World War, as the Lukis and Island Museum, located in a redundant church. It served as a museum until safety considerations caused its closure to the public in the early 1970s. However, the island then appointed its first full time curator and planning began for the present museum in Candie Gardens. This opened to general acclaim in 1978.",,"Candie Gardens

Wolverhampton Central Library,"Wolverhampton's first Public Library was set up in 1869, under the Public Libraries Act and was situated in the Old Athenaeum in Queen Street. The library became extremely popular and in 1872, the Council moved it to larger premises in Garrick Street. By 1896, approximately 1100 people per day were using its facilities. 































































































































Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee of 1897 led to the building of the present Central Library. The mayor, Alderman S.Craddock, thought that the construction of a new free library would be a fitting monument to mark the occasion and so with the agreement of the Council, a committee was set up to raise money for a new building. The Diamond Jubilee Fund as it was called, eventually raised 9000 pounds. 































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Instead of commissioning a designer for the building, the Council decided to hold a competition for architects to submit their designs. A similar competition for the planning of the West Park had been held some years earlier. The conditions of entry were laid down by the Borough Surveyor, with all entrants having to consider construction costs and interior design, both of which were not to exceed 1O,000 pounds and their exterior design had to include something related to the Diamond Jubilee which it commemorated. The competition was won by Henry Hare. 































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The Council decided to build the new library on the site of what was previously the Old Theatre Royal on the corner of Garrick Street and Cleveland Road, land which had been purchased in 1897. They then had the theatre demolished and sold the remaining materials; the money gained being added to the building fund. 































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































On July 23rd 1900, a foundation stone was laid on the site by the Duke of York, who later became King George V. When construction actually began, the building plans did not totally comply with Hare's original design, various changes having been made, with some rooms having been re-sited. However, the building was completed despite these changes and in 1902, the new Central Library was officially opened. 































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The interior of the building consisted of four main rooms, the Newsroom, with the Magazine Room opposite, on the ground floor and the Lending Library, with the Reference Library opposite on the top floor. To reduce noise level in the building, the floors were laid in cork. 































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































By 1936, increased use of the library by the public, led to an extension being added to the building. This resulted in rooms being re-sited to their present locations (see description).

The museum is now based at Uig Community Centre in Timsgarry, Isle of Lewis.  Rotating displays on crofting, fishing, archaeology, the Lewis Chessmen (found locally in 1831) and the Viking occupation is complemented by a substantial archive of local records, photographs and genealogy.

Castle Cornet,"Castle Cornet has been Guernsey's harbour fortress since at least the 13th century. Originally on a separate islet, it was joined to the main island by a bridge and extensive harbour developments in the 1850s. It was garrisoned by the British Army until the Second World War and then by the Germans during the war itself. After the war it was given to the Guernsey people by the British government and has been opened to the public since the 1950s. A number of museums have been established within its walls, including a Maritime Museum, The Story of Castle Cornet (which interprets the building's history) and the 201 Squadron RAF museum. The latter reflects the Island's continuing affiliation with the maritime reconnaisance squadron based at RAF Kinloss. The museums form part of Guernsey Museums & Galleries, a division of the Culture and Leisure Department.",,"St Peter Port,GY1 1AU",GY1 1AU,,,Central Government,,,The States of Guernsey,South West,,www.museums.gov.gg,2014-03-23T21:21:43.48Z,peter@museum.guernsey.net,01481 714 021,01481 721 657

D-Day Museum & Overlord Embroidery,"The D-Day Museum was opened in 1984 to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of D-Day. Its centrepiece is the magnificent Overlord Embroidery commissioned by Lord Dulverton of Batsford (1915-92) as a tribute to the sacrifice and heroism of those men and women who took part in Operation Overlord. 

The Overlord Embroidery was conceived by Lord Dulverton as a modern counterpart to the Bayeux Tapestry. Designed by artist Sandra Lawrence, the Embroidery took five years to complete. It measures 272 feet and is the largest work of its kind in the world. As you look at the stirring scenes, an accompanying multi-language Soundalive commentary brings the events to life. The Museum's unique and dramatic film show, which includes original, historic footage and archive film, is an equally moving experience.","For access details, please see our website: www.ddaymuseum.co.uk","Clarence Esplanade,Portsmouth,Hampshire,PO5 3NT",PO5 3NT,-1.0893105135805,50.7783535560189,Local/Regional government,,,Portsmouth City Council,South East,,www.ddaymuseum.co.uk,2014-03-23T21:21:56.751Z,info@ddaymuseum.co.uk,023 9287 5276,023 9282 7261

English Folk Dance & Song Society,"The library is called the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library (VWML) in honour of the eminent composer, song collector and President of the EFDSS, Ralph Vaughan Williams, who died in 1958.  Up 'til then it was called the Cecil Sharp Library because it chiefly comprised Sharp������s personal library, which he bequeathed to the EFDS in 1924.  Its first permanent home was established with the opening of Cecil Sharp House in 1930, and Sharp������s daughter Joan was the first librarian.  With the amalgamation of EFDS and the Folk-Song Society and subsequent bequests, donations and purchases, the library has developed considerably over the years, most notably with the addition of the literature, sound and manuscript collections of other eminent folklorists and collectors of the twentieth century.",,"Vaughan Williams Memorial Library

Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons,"The Hunterian Museum is based on the collection of the surgeon John Hunter (1728-1793), which was purchased by the government in 1799 and presented to the Company (now the Royal College) of Surgeons. Significant additions were made to the collections of the museum during the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1907 the collection of the Odontological Society of Great Britain was placed on loan to the College. In 1941 the College was badly damaged by bombing, and approximately 60% of the holdings were destroyed. After the end of the war a new Hunterian Museum was created to hold the surviving parts of the Hunterian and College collections, and a separate Odontological Museum was created for the Odontological Society's collection, which was formally transferred into the College's ownership. In 2005 the Hunterian and Odontological Museums were refurbished and merged into a single public museum, now known as the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons.",Wheelchair access via Nuffield Entrance.

"University of Wolverhampton, Harrison Learning Centre","The University of Wolverhampton gained its university status in 1992, but Wolverhampton as a city has a strong history of education dating back hundreds of years to 1512 and initial plans to found Wolverhampton Grammar School. 

It was 400 years later that the seeds of the University itself were sown with the creation of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College. A merger with the local College of Art saw the birth of The Polytechnic, Wolverhampton, in 1969. 

Since becoming a University, Wolverhampton has continued to grow, opening a multi-million pound campus in Telford in 1994, the Wolverhampton Science Park in partnership with Wolverhampton Council in 1996. In 1997, two hi-tech Learning Centres in Telford and Wolverhampton opened offering state-of-the-art facilities to students and staff alike. While 1999 has seen the launch of the Regional Primary Centre, Leadership Centre and Competitiveness Centre, each offering unprecedented levels of support to the local community in education and business.","Wheelchair/mobility-impaired access, Lifts equipped with low placed buttons with Braille and a voice floor announcement system, Traveller rollator walker, Accessible toilets, Marked safety refuges in the case of fire.","St Peter's Square,Wolverhampton,West Midlands,WV1 1RH",WV1 1RH,,,Further/Higher Education,,,University of Wolverhampton,West Midlands,,http://asp.wlv.ac.uk/Level3.asp?UserType=6&Level3=823,2014-03-23T21:21:59.127Z,learningcentredirect@wlv.ac.uk,01902 321986,01902 322300

Labour History Archive and Study Centre,"The Labour History Archive and Study Centre (LHASC) is the only specialist repository for the political wing of the Labour movement. It holds records for working class political organisations from the Chartists to New Labour. LHASC holds the archives of the Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain. The collections have been used for a variety of research purposes providing an insight into the social, political and economic life of the last two centuries. Besides housing papers of political organisations the LHASC collects the personal papers of radical politicians, writers and left wing organisations. The archives are housed at the People's History Museum's head office at 103 Princess Street, Manchester. The archive collection compliments the objects, photographs and banners found in the museum' s collections and researchers may well find material of interest in both.",,"103 Princess Street

"Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, University of Glasgow","The Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery cares for the object collections of Glasgow University, and makes them accessible to public visitors and to academic and research users, in Glasgow and around the world.



The Hunterian is Scotland's oldest surviving public museum. It opened in 1807, to house the collections of William Hunter, anatomist and physician, who left his collections to the University when he died in 1783. Hunter was one of the great European collectors of the 18th century, and had accumulated superb collections of coins, art, books and manuscripts, anatomical preparations, ethnographic material, minerals, and insects. All this material came to Glasgow.



Since then, material has been bequeathed, donated, arrived via University research and teaching, and in some cases, purchased. The collections are now among the finest, largest, and most comprehensive in Scotland, with over a million objects.



The Hunterian collections encompass a wide range of areas, including numismatics, art (e.g. globally important Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Whistler material), anatomy, palaeontology, geology, zoology, archaeology (especially Scottish Roman archaeology), ethnography (e.g. Captain Cook material), and scientific and medical instruments well as general historical material. There are extensive archives relating to the collections, which add to their historical and scientific value. All the Hunterian collections are of Recognised National Significance under the Scottish government recognition scheme.","Our aim is to make all of our displays accessible, in the widest sense, to everyone who wishes to see the Hunterian collections. As well as physical access, we provide online access to many of our objects via our online catalogue and other web resources.



Currently, wheelchair-bound visitors, or people with motor disabilities, can access all areas of the Museum, by lift, while in the Art Gallery, access is by ramp to ground floor, and thereafter by lift to the basement and first floor Print Gallery.



Unfortunately, access is not possible to the upper floors of the replica Mackintosh House, though we are currently looking at alternatives.



There is limited wheelchair access to the Zoology Museum. A platform lift has been installed at the front door of the Graham Kerr Building which will allow visitors to access part of the Zoology Museum. Wheelchair users are advised to make an appointment to visit by contacting us either by phone (0141 330 4772) or email (mreilly@museum.gla.ac.uk)



Both the Museum and the Art Gallery have toilets for disabled people. There is no disabled toilet in the Graham Kerr Building. The nearest facility is in the adjacent Wolfson Link Building.","University of Glasgow,
