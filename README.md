## Culture Grid

Converting and storing culture grid web service data on institutions for use in other projects - project now archived.

### Background

The culture grid was an aggregation platform run by the Collections Trust, and hosted web services that provided details of cultural instititions, collections, and more.

There is [a blog post by Nick Poole](https://museumscomputergroup.org.uk/culture-grid/), previously CEO of the Collections Trust, that gives some background to this, the wider work of aggregating museum data, and the People's Network.

While the culture grid's API is still running, this repository is a simple converter to convert the data held on institutions into CSV format for repurposing (and building upon as it's out of date).

See [culture_data.csv](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/culture-grid/blob/master/culture_data.csv) for an extract.
